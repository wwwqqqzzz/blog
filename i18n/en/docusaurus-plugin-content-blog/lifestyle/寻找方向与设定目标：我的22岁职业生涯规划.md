Lately, I've been struggling with thoughts about my career direction and life plans. At 22, I often feel lost, unsure about what goals to pursue and how to structure my career path. This post reflects my honest attempt to organize my thoughts and create a reference point I can look back on—though I'm aware plans often change when they meet reality.

## I. My Current Situation and Challenges

**Where I stand now**: I'm 22, have built a personal blog and completed a few basic projects, but I lack systematic planning and clear direction. My technical knowledge includes front-end fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and some framework experience (React, Vue), but with limited depth. Most of my learning has been self-directed and somewhat scattered.

**My real struggles**:
- Should I pursue remote work opportunities or look for a traditional job? Both paths seem to have significant pros and cons.
- How can I develop meaningful projects that actually enhance my competitiveness rather than just adding to my portfolio?
- Is my current technical foundation sufficient, or am I overestimating my skills?
- How can I balance making money now versus investing in long-term growth?

Sometimes I feel like I'm walking through fog with no clear path ahead. What keeps me up at night is the fear that the choices I make now might close doors I didn't even know existed.

## II. My Practical Decisions and Action Plan

### 1. Work Approach Decision

After much back-and-forth, I've decided to pursue both remote work and traditional employment paths over the next 6 months instead of forcing myself to choose right now:

**Months 1-3**:
- Mornings: Focused learning on one technology at a time (not jumping between multiple)
- Afternoons: Exploring remote work platforms and submitting proposals for small projects
- Evenings: Improving my resume and online profiles with actual projects, not just buzzwords

**Months 4-6**:
- Continue developing 1-2 substantial projects (not 3+ half-finished ones)
- Apply for both remote projects and traditional jobs weekly
- Evaluate at the end of month 6 which path feels more promising based on real results, not just theory

### 2. My Project Development Plan (Realistic Version)

**Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website (1.5 months)**
- Technology: Next.js + TailwindCSS (technologies I've already started learning)
- Features: Project showcase, skill visualization, blog integration, contact form
- Challenge: Focus on a clean, functional design rather than trying to implement every feature

**Project 2: Simple Task Management App (2 months)**
- Technology: React + Firebase (avoiding complex backend setup initially)
- Features: Basic user authentication, task management, simple data visualization
- Learning focus: User authentication, database design, state management

**Project 3: Performance Optimization Study (1 month)**
- Apply optimization techniques to the first two projects
- Document the process and results on my blog
- This is more about learning than building something new

### 3. Strategies for Remote Work Challenges

**Preparation Phase**:
- Study 5 successful remote developers' journeys through interviews and blogs
- Complete 2 skill assessments that are actually relevant to my target work
- Create 3 proposal templates I can customize quickly (rather than 10 generic ones)

**Entry Phase**:
- Start with 2-3 small projects, accepting lower rates for reviews
- Join 1-2 remote work communities to learn from others (not trying to be in every community)
- Track proposal success rate and adjust weekly

**Growth Phase**:
- Gradually increase rates based on client feedback
- Focus on building 3-5 quality client relationships rather than constantly finding new clients
- Develop pricing based on project complexity rather than arbitrary packages

## III. My Realistic Career Development Path

### 1-Year Goals

- Complete 2 high-quality projects and deploy them (not 3+ mediocre ones)
- Gain initial remote work experience (at least 2 paid projects)
- Establish professional online presence (focused on GitHub and portfolio)
- Technical improvement: Master React hooks and context, learn TypeScript basics, understand Node.js fundamentals

### 3-Year Vision

**Year 2 Plan**:
- Technical focus: Deep dive into either frontend frameworks or backend development (not both simultaneously)
- Career development: Either raise my freelance rates by 30% or secure a junior developer position
- Personal brand: Start writing technical tutorials on specific problems I've solved

**Year 3 Plan**:
- Technical leadership: Lead small projects or components within larger teams
- Career development: Move toward mid-level developer role or established freelancer status
- Community impact: Regular blog contributions and possibly mentor a beginner

### 5-10 Year Perspective

- Become knowledgeable in my chosen technical area (recognizing "expert" status takes longer than I initially thought)
- Build a modest but engaged technical audience through consistent value
- Achieve financial stability that allows some freedom of choice in projects
- Help others enter the field through mentorship and content

## IV. Holistic Life Goals (The Human Side)

### Health Goals

- Establish a simple morning exercise routine (start with just 15 minutes)
- Improve my diet by cooking at home 3 times weekly (not completely eliminating takeout)
- Improve sleep by reducing screen time 30 minutes before bed
- Find one physical activity I actually enjoy, not just what I think I should do

### Relationship Goals

- Family: Have meaningful conversations with family members weekly
- Friends: Maintain core friendships through regular check-ins
- Social circle: Join one interest group or community activity
- Build a small professional network of people I genuinely connect with

### Personal Growth Goals

- Reading plan: Balance between technical books and non-technical interests
- Learn one non-technical skill that brings me joy (photography/cooking/drawing)
- Journal weekly to track my thoughts and progress
- Develop 1-2 sustainable interests outside of tech

### Financial Goals

- Build an emergency fund covering 3 months of expenses
- Learn investment basics and start with small, low-risk investments
- Explore one potential passive income source
- Create a basic financial plan that includes saving and investing

## V. Monthly Reality Check

On the last Sunday of each month, I'll ask myself:

1. What actual progress did I make this month? (Concrete accomplishments, not just activities)
2. What activities proved valuable? What was a waste of time?
3. Do my goals still make sense given what I've learned?
4. What obstacles am I facing, and do I need to pivot or persist?
5. How are market and technology trends affecting my plans?
6. Is my approach sustainable or am I burning out?
7. What should be my focus for next month?

## A Personal Commitment

This plan isn't a rigid blueprint but a starting point—I expect to modify it as I learn and grow. At 22, I'm still figuring things out, but having some direction is better than none.

My commitment to myself:
1. Make progress every day, even if it's just a small step
2. Review and adjust regularly based on real experiences
3. Be kind to myself when I fall short, but keep moving forward
4. Balance career growth with physical health and relationships
5. Stay adaptable—the tech world changes quickly, and so will my plans

Career development isn't a straight line; it's a continuous process of exploration and adjustment. This plan is my current compass, not a fixed map.

It's time to move from planning to action. Today's small step is tomorrow's foundation.
